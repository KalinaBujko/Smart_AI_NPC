# Smart_AI_NPC

This is an experimental project created in **Unreal Engine 5**, showcasing conversational AI using the **Convai plugin**.

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project was to explore dynamic, unscripted conversations with NPCs using AI-powered personalities.  
Each character is built in Convai with their own memory, personality, and role within a short quest.

Key Features:
- Real-time dialogue generation using Convai
- Custom personality setup per character
- NPCs react to player proximity and quest progress
- Support for both voice input and text input
- Light narrative structure with multiple character roles

Characters include:
- **Kael** – angry and frustrated after losing his blade  
- **Mirelle** – a mysterious mastermind  
- **Thorn** – a dreamy and comedic wanderer  

This project is an experiment in using AI to support narrative and bring emotional depth to game characters.
